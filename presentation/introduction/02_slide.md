# An Observation
.notes There may be a better word than observation 

* Writing a regular expression that doesn't do what you want
* is more common than writing one that causes a syntax error
* despite the fact that it failed because of its syntax.

# Semantic Failure, Syntactic Confusion
* Failures with regular expressions are usually semantic
* "I don't think that word means what you think it means."
* Confusion caused by syntax and metaphor

Joe the programmer thinks one thing, and the computer is doing something entirely different.

# State Machines
* The regex characters are the _transitions_
* The characters of input are the _events_
* The states are generated by the compiler

# Example: /^abc$/
* "a", "b" and "c" are named transitions
* ![abc](abc.png)

.notes Ragel converts a series of machines into a table-driven* FSM that reads bytes one at a time until it reaches the end of input
